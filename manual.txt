project name FAKESTON:

FAKESTON_RUN   -FTF-   
 - this tool replays fakeston test file (FTF) and EVEMU files. the output
   from this tool is the actual notify_*() call sequence that happens inside
   the compositor. it is a black box testing approach.
 - the user can find bugs in the compositor by comparing this actual
   notify call sequence with the expected notify call sequence.
 - the compositor programmers can spot regressions early using this tool
