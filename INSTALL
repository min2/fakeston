FAKESTON is used to replay weston evdev captures
/mouse click, keys, touch, axis, etc./ to weston's evdev.c

SETUP / USEAGE

   ./build.sh
   ./fakeston_run    fakeston_test_file

EXAMPLE USEAGE

   ./fakeston_run   ./emudumps/hw_test3/ftestcase1562749452.txt

You can now see the compositor notify() called. they are
produced from replaying all the evemu captures /in parallel/
via evdev.c exactly as if you were running a weston compositor.

MAKE CAPTURES WITH WESTON

1. apply patch/ to weston:

   git am ../fakeston/patch/0001-Hacked-weston.patch

2. build weston (as usual)
3. create captures with weston
